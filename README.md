Creating a Neural Network models to solve many complex problems.

In this, I am using Tensorflow 2.0 and keras libraries.
This package contains complete Artificial Neural Network and Optimization methods.


Stepts followed in solving the probles are as follows, 

Import all the necessery libraries,

Import the dataset,

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis,

Feature Engineering,

Building a model,

Training the model,

Checking the validation score,

Testing the model.
